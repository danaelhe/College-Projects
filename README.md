# College-Projects
Projects I've done in college, all Java and very OOO.

Assignment8 is a Silicon Valley trail (Spin off of Oregon Trail game). 
I used Java on eclipse to create a basic game similar to Oregon Trail. I designed a basic user interface with Java Swing and design patterns like Iterator, Factory, and Observer.


The Queens App is an Android app of the classic Queens App game.
I used Android Studio.
Rules: The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
